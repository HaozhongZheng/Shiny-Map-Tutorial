## Description
In this tutorial, we want to introduce how to build an APP that incorporates a map that is built on shapefiles. Main packages used would be **shiny** and **ggspatial**. Basically we would first give a quick introduction of shiny, and then introduce the preprocessing work of shapefiles to produce plots about maps, then we would build an advanced shiny app widget with what we introduced in the previous part.
